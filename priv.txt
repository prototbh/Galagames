PFTP respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, your rights under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and how to contact us. It covers both Xbox console and Windows PC deployments, ensuring compliance with Microsoft Store requirements and global data-protection standards.

1. Information We Collect
Device & Usage Data. We automatically collect device identifiers (e.g., Xbox User ID, machine ID), IP addresses, operating system version, and basic usage metrics (e.g., feature taps, downloads) to diagnose issues and improve the App’s functionality 

Folder & File Metadata. When you select a folder or download files, we record only file names, sizes, and timestamps—never the file contents—so we can display folder contents and manage downloads in PFTP 

User-Provided URLs. If you enter a URL in the App’s UI (e.g., http://yourphoneip:port/file.jpg), we temporarily use that string to fetch the file; we do not persist it beyond the download operation.

2. How We Use Your Information
App Functionality. To display your local IP, list folder contents, and download files, PFTP needs access to device metadata and the URLs you provide 

Diagnostics & Support. We use anonymized usage data to troubleshoot crashes and improve performance; no personally identifiable information is included in telemetry.

Compliance. We may process minimal data to comply with legal obligations (e.g., responding to law-enforcement requests).

3. Legal Bases & Consumer Rights
GDPR (EU/EEA). If you’re in the EU/EEA, we process data with your consent or to perform our contract with you (Art. 6(1)(a),(b) GDPR) 
GDPR.eu

Other Jurisdictions. We comply with local privacy laws where we operate; please contact us for details.

4. Sharing & Disclosure

Microsoft Requirements. We do not link or federate your Xbox Live account identifier with any external service, per Microsoft Store Policy § 10.13.9 

Legal Requests. We may disclose data to comply with court orders or legal processes.

5. Data Retention & Security
Retention. We keep your usage data for no longer than 12 months and purge URL strings and file metadata immediately after the download session ends.

Security. We implement industry-standard measures (encryption in transit, access controls) to protect your data from unauthorized access.

6. Children’s Privacy
PFTP is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors; if we learn we have, we will delete it promptly.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in legal requirements or App features. The “Last Updated” date at the top will indicate when changes occur. Please review it periodically.

Why HTTP Content & Capabilities Must Be Enabled
Local HTTP Server Access. PFTP fetches files from a phone-based HTTP server (e.g., http://yourphoneip:port/). By default, UWP/Xbox apps require explicit manifest declarations to permit any network access, especially non-HTTPS endpoints
